  "report": "Extent Assessment:\nThe waterlogging completely submerges the near-side roadway and extends toward distant sections with partial coverage, primarily affecting multiple vehicle lanes. Adjacent sidewalks exhibit no significant waterlogging but show dampened surfaces due to overflow from the roadway.\n\nDepth Assessment:\nThe depth of the water appears to submerge the lower parts of wheels. Since the cars seem to be about a third submerged up their wheels, this suggests a shallow to moderate level of water. Additionally, the pedestrians walking on the sidewalk are slightly less affected, indicating that sidewalks are less affected than the roadway.\n\nRisk and Impact Assessment:\n1. Traffic Impact: The waterlogged street has not halted traffic entirely, as vehicles are visible attempting to navigate through. However, the condition poses potential stalling risks, especially to smaller vehicles, as water may seep into engine compartments.\n2. Pedestrian Movement: Movement along the sidewalk is somewhat feasible, but people need to navigate carefully to avoid deeper parts near the curb's edge.\n3. Risk of Water Ingress: The risk of water getting into lower parts of vehicles exists, primarily for those smaller or stopped too long in deeper sections.\n4. Obstructions: Bicycles and motorbikes are collected near the sidewalk's edge, obstructing some pedestrian spaces."
