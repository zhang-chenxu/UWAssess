  "report": "Extent Assessment:\nThe image shows that the entire road surface is covered with water, indicating significant waterlogging. The water extends across the visible width of the road, suggesting it affects all traffic lanes.\n\nDepth Assessment:\nIn the background, the water depth appears relatively shallow, reaching the wheel rims of the white car. The minor splashes generated as vehicles pass through suggest limited depth in those areas. The water does not submerge the base of the road barriers, further supporting this observation. In contrast, lane markings in the foreground are obscured, indicating a deeper accumulation of water.\n\nRisk and Impact Assessment:\n1. Traffic Impact: Full coverage of the road by water may cause congestion or traffic delays, particularly if vehicles reduce speed or avoid the area.\n2. Vehicle Safety: The risk of hydroplaning is elevated due to the waterlogged conditions. Drivers should proceed with caution, especially in low-clearance or lightweight vehicles."
