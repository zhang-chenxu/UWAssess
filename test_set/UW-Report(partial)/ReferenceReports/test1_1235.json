  "report": "Extent Assessment:\nThe waterlogging affects a substantial section of the street. From the perspective of the image, the waterlogged area stretches from the foreground to deep into the background along the central road lane. The water covers almost the entire width of the two-way street.\n\nDepth Assessment:\nThe water depth is sufficient to partially submerge the wheels of parked vehicles, reaching from the lower edge to the midpoint of the tires. Road markings are blurry, suggesting consistent water coverage with significant depth across the entire road surface.\n\nRisk and Impact Assessment:\n1. Traffic: The waterlogging poses a significant challenge to vehicle passage through the road due to the depth, which is risky for vehicles. There is a high chance of water ingress into lower sections of cars, potentially leading to stalling or engine failure.\n2. Pedestrian Movement: The sidewalks appear unaffected, but accessing the road from the curbs would be difficult without wading through water. This restricts safe pedestrian passage and may pose slipping risks.\n3. Property Risk: Vehicles parked along the road are at risk of water damage. The presence of nearby commercial and residential buildings implies a risk to property if water levels rise."
